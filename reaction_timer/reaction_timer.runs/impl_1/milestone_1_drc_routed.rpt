2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net count_rset_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin count_rset_reg/L3_2/O, cell count_rset_reg/L3_2 (in count_rset_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net disp_select_reg[0]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin disp_select_reg[0]/L3_2/O, cell disp_select_reg[0]/L3_2 (in disp_select_reg[0] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net dot_en_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin dot_en_reg/L3_2/O, cell dot_en_reg/L3_2 (in dot_en_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ff0/AR[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ff0/disp_select_reg[0]_i_1/O, cell ff0/disp_select_reg[0]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ff0/dot_en__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ff0/disp_select_reg[2]_i_1/O, cell ff0/disp_select_reg[2]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ff4/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ff4/SEGMENT_LIGHT_OUT_reg[0]_i_2/O, cell ff4/SEGMENT_LIGHT_OUT_reg[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
